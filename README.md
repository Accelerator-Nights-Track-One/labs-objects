# JavaScript Object Drills  

In this section, you'll practice creating, accessing, modifying, and working with objects in JavaScript. You'll write programs that solve problems by manipulating object properties and methods, as well as working with nested objects and arrays of objects.  

### Instructions:  
In **objects.js**, for each prompt, write a JavaScript program that solves the problem using objects. Make sure to run the program in your terminal to check if it works as expected.

## Object Basics  

1. **Create a Simple Object**  
   Write a program to create an object named `car` with properties `make`, `model`, and `year`. Print the object.  

2. **Access Properties**  
   Write a program that prints the `make` and `model` properties of the `car` object.  

3. **Add a New Property**  
   Add a `color` property to the `car` object and print the updated object.

4. **Delete a Property**  
   Delete the `year` property from the `car` object and print the updated object.  

5. **Modify a Property**  
   Update the `color` property in the `car` object to `"red"` and print the updated object.  

6. **Check for Property**  
   Write a program to check if the `car` object has a `doors` property. Print `true` or `false`.  

7. **Iterate Through an Object**  
   Use a `for...in` loop to print all the keys and values in the `car` object.

## Nested Objects  

8. **Create a Nested Object**  
   Create an object `book` with properties `title`, `author`, and `details`. The `details` property should be another object containing `publisher` and `year`. Print the object.  

9. **Access Nested Properties**  
   Write a program to print the `publisher` and `year` of the `book` object.  

10. **Modify Nested Properties**  
    Update the `year` property inside `details` of the `book` object to the current year. Print the updated object.  

11. **Add Nested Properties**  
    Add a new property `pages` to the `details` object inside `book`. Set it to `350` and print the updated object.  

12. **Delete Nested Properties**  
    Delete the `publisher` property from the `details` object inside `book`. Print the updated object.

## BONUS: Arrays of Objects  

13. **Create an Array of Objects**  
    Create an array `students` with three objects, each representing a student. Each object should have properties `name`, `age`, and `grade`. Print the array.  

14. **Access Objects in Array**  
    Write a program to print the `name` of the second student in the `students` array.  

15. **Modify an Object in an Array**  
    Update the `grade` of the first student in the `students` array to `"A"`. Print the updated array.  

16. **Add a New Object to the Array**  
    Add a new student object to the `students` array and print the updated array.  

17. **Remove an Object from the Array**  
    Remove the last student object from the `students` array and print the updated array.

## SUPER BONUS: Advanced Object Operations  

18. **Copy an Object**  
    Use the spread operator to create a copy of the `car` object and modify its `make` property. Print both the original and the copied object.  

19. **Merge Two Objects**  
    Create two objects, `person` and `job`, with some properties. Merge them into a new object and print it.  

20. **Object Methods**  
    Create an object `calculator` with methods `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. Each method should take two numbers as arguments and return the result. Use the `calculator` object to perform operations and print the results.
